[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Kairn/travis-ci-angular.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Kairn/travis-ci-angular)

This is a dummy project. The purpose is to test the build flow of Travis CI with automated deployment to AWS S3 bucket.

**Update:** Deployment is now being suspended due to the restriction on the number of access keys one can obtain on AWS platform.
